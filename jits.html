                    Check out this video from the my great friend Alfy, who was fortunate enough to train with my homie from Florida, Chris 'Squirrel'
                    Crawford.  
                    <br>
                    Squirrel, is a young brown belt under the 10th Planet System. He originally started his BJJ journey in Jacksonville, FL and now 
                    currently resides in Tampa, FL where he teaches and trains out of Kaizen MMA Tampa.  This year alone has been a very active year
                    for Chris, which has resulted in him even being featured on UFC Fight Pass for Combat Jiu-Jitsu Worlds, where he won his match
                    in overtime.
