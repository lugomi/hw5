                My name is Miguel Lugo and I'm currently studying computer science
                at Oregon State University. #gobeavs
                <br>
                I'm also a blue belt in 10th Planet Jiu-Jitsu and have had the chance
                to train in many gyms all over the country.  I first started training
                Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu back in 2011, but didn't start taking it serious until
                2016. 
                <br>
                Although I live in Oregon, I got my blue belt through my instructor in 
                10th Planet Atlanta in May of 2018.  I was fortunate enough to find my instructor
                after losing to a 16 year old that trained as the same school in a local tournament.
                <br>
                My favorite aspect of the 10th Planet system is the focus on jiu-jitsu for MMA and 
                the unorthodox aspect of technique when compared to traditional BJJ schools. I also am 
                a huge fanatic of the fact that the school is primarily no-gi, since it makes you learn
                how to grapple without relying on the traditional kimono and makes things more realistic
                for self-defense situations.
