                These are some upcoming events that I'm beyond stoked for. This summer with restrictions getting loosened,
                us fans are going to be treated to some amazing events in all realms of combat sports.

                My personal favorite to look out for is Combat Jiu-Jitsu Worlds. Of course, I have also included other events
                that are worth watching!

                        Of all the events listed, this has to be the one that I'm most looking forward to. 
                        Some of the best athletes at the 170 weight class will prove to show who is the toughest grappler.
                        The two people to watch for are Nathan Orchard and Roberto Jimenez.
